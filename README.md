# Movie Revenue Prediction
In this project, I attempt to find characteristics about a movie that contribute to a large total gross when the opening gross amount is relatively low.  I use data from BoxOfficeMojo.com and attempt to build a linear relationship as well as classification algorithms to predict whether a troubled director's movie would gross well despite low opening figures.  While this is still a work in progress, feel free to check out my python notebooks.
